Project Name: Project Alpha
Code Name: DeepBlue
Status: Phase 2 (Development)
Launch Date: Q3 2025

Description:
Project Alpha is a next-generation "Context Engineering" engine designed to optimize LLM memory usage.
It utilizes a 3-pillar approach:
1. Long-Term Memory: Cached system prompts.
2. Scratchpad: Iterative working memory.
3. State Isolation: Minimizing context pollution.

Key Stakeholders:
- Lead: Dr. Emily Chen
- Engineering: Team Z
- Product: Sarah Jones

Budget: $2.5M
Current Rissk: API Latency is higher than expected (200ms).
Strategies: Implementing "Prompt Caching" to reduce TTFT.
